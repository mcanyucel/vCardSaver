This project is for reading a list of contacts from an Excel file (currently .xls only), and then saving them as vCard 2.1
The user can select the sheet as well as name and e-mail columns from dropdown menus.
The connection to Excel is established by OleDb.
The output could be a single vcf file that contains all the contacts, or seperate files for each contact.
The project is completed.
